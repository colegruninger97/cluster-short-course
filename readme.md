# Cluster Computing Short Course

This repository contains the material I use to teach the combined UNC/UH cluster
computing two-day workshop. The main goals of this project are:
* *Building vocabulary*: students should know what a shell is, ssh, and enough
  other vocabulary so that they can ask (or google) intelligent questions.
* *Familiarity with the shell*: most work on clusters is done in a terminal -
  not all students have used this technology before. Students will get to use a
  shell and learn enough to get around.
* *Version control concepts*: no-one is an island - modern computing is done in
  teams and groups distributed across the planet. Students will learn the basics
  of sharing work and resolving changes with the git version control system.
* *Compile and install basic tools*: frequently, in scientific computing, we
  need to compile our own software. Students will compile software with
  autotools and cmake and do some basic troubleshooting.
* *Thinking in terms of jobs and noninteractive computing*: Putting it all
  together, we'll learn how to write job scripts, written in shell, to queue our
  work on supercomputers.
